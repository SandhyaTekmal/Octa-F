# Eco-Tag 🌍

Eco-Tag is a wearable environmental health monitoring device designed to provide real-time alerts for invisible environmental risks such as air pollution, extreme heat, humidity, and UV radiation.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Environmental risks are invisible and often noticed only after health problems occur. Existing monitoring solutions are expensive, non-personalized, or require active user attention.

## 💡 Solution
Eco-Tag continuously monitors:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Air Quality (AQI)
- UV Index
- VOC Levels

It converts environmental data into simple alerts via voice notifications:
- SAFE
- CAUTION
- DANGER
